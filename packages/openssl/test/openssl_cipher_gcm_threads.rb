# An authentication verdict must survive other threads.
#
# The C answers 0x01 || plaintext for a message that authenticates and an empty
# string for one that does not, so the verdict is part of the answer. It used
# to be read from a separate last_error call, which is a different thing: an
# empty string is a legitimate plaintext (the message of zero bytes), so
# "empty" could not also mean "forged", and between the decrypt and the
# question another worker's success could clear the slot. A forged message then
# arrived as valid empty plaintext -- measured at 13 to 31 acceptances in 2400
# on this machine, so a run of this test on the old code fails rather than
# merely being unlucky.
