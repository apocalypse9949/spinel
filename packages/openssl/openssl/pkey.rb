# OpenSSL::PKey::EC -- elliptic-curve keys, in the shape #4221 settled on:
# CRuby's names where CRuby has a spelling, raw bytes where CRuby would hand
# back a BN or an EC::Point.
#
# So `EC.generate("prime256v1")` and `key.dh_compute_key(peer)` are the names
# a CRuby program already writes, but a key's halves are Strings --
# `private_key_bytes` is the scalar, `public_key_bytes` is the X9.62
# uncompressed point, 0x04 || X || Y -- and dh_compute_key takes the peer's
# bytes rather than a Point built out of a BN. `OpenSSL::BN`, `EC::Group` and
# `EC::Point` are not here, and a program that builds one fails at COMPILE
# time the way the rest of this package's gaps do.
#
# That is a real subset, and it is a deliberate one: those three classes exist
# in CRuby to express things this runtime has no other use for, and every
# protocol that names raw EC keys -- RFC 8291 Web Push, JWK's x/y halves,
# WebAuthn, ES256 -- names them as the byte strings above. A program that
# reaches for EC::Point is already doing protocol work that has to know the
# encoding anyway.
#
# A key is its bytes, so nothing on the C side outlives a call: there is no
# handle to release and no slot to run out of, unlike the connection table
# SSLSocket holds. An abandoned key costs nothing.
