# The BINARY (ASCII-8BIT) tag survives the operations that cannot change what
# the bytes are: a concatenation, a join, a repeat, a slice. Ruby compares
# equal bytes as equal Strings only when the encodings are comparable, so a
# result that loses the tag stops comparing equal to the same bytes from pack,
# File.binread or a socket -- silently, and only once a byte is >= 0x80.
#
# Interpolation is NOT covered and is deliberately not asserted here: it is
# assembled inline by the emitter into one raw buffer rather than through a
# runtime function, so propagating the tag there is a codegen change on the
# hottest string path in the language and wants a benchmark, not a guess.
# "#{bin}" therefore still answers UTF-8 where CRuby answers ASCII-8BIT.
