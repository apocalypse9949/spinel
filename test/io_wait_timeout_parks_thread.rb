# A timed readiness wait parks the green thread, not its OS worker.
#
# 300 threads wait, with a 3s timeout, on one pipe nobody has written to
# yet -- half through IO#wait_readable, half through a one-io IO.select.
# The main thread sleeps briefly and then writes a byte. When the wait
# parks the green thread, every waiter wakes readable within milliseconds
# of the write. When it blocks the OS worker in select(2) instead, every
# worker is pinned by a waiter, the main thread cannot run to write the
# byte, and each worker serves its waiters one full timeout at a time:
# nobody sees the byte, and the run takes minutes.
